QXmpp (Cross-platform C++ XMPP client and server library)

QXmpp strives to be as easy to use as possible, the underlying TCP
socket, the core XMPP RFCs (RFC3920 and RFC3921) and XMPP extensions
have been nicely encapsulated into classes. It is written in C++ and
uses Qt framework.

Uses opus, speex, theora and vpx codecs.
